# Bip32 Cheat Sheet

I write these notes as I was studying the implementation of HD wallets. 
It helped me structure my thoughts as I went through the BIP documents ([BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) and [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)).

If you're looking for an actual implementation for this that is easy to follow check [my project written in Elixir](https://github.com/AgileAlpha/block_keys).
